### Abstract
**Background/Question/Methods**

Large amounts of on-farm and remotely sensed data can transform agriculture through implementation of adaptive management. The site, time, and history specificity of fields has complicated integration of ecological principles into an agriculture focused on regionwide prescriptions. Crop managers now have the ability to generate field-specific management plans using field-specific data to optimize inputs based on pollution minimization and profit maximization. For example, traditional nitrogen (N) fertilizer management consisted of applying a uniform rate, causing N inefficiencies and non-point nitrate pollution. Precision agriculture technologies provide an empirical approach to adaptive management. This research seeks to identify spatiotemporal drivers of variation in production (grain yield), quality (grain protein), and net-returns for Northern Great Plains small-grain agroecosystems and evaluates their relatedness and consistency between fields. Winter-wheat yield and protein, and as-applied N data have been collected from fields, along with remotely sensed topographic, weather, and historical vegetation index data, to evaluate the spatial variation in production, quality, and net-returns for wheat across  years. For four fields, generalized additive models were used to fit residuals of production, quality, and net-return as a function of as-applied N, topographic variables, weather, soil moisture, soil type, and prior productivity (NDVI up to two years prior).

**Results/Conclusions**

Regardless of management, every field experienced variation in production, quality, and net-returns across a field for a given year and across years for given points in fields. While in most fields, as-applied nitrogen was expected to be the major source of variation in crop responses when experimental rates were randomly applied, we have observed that in some cases, there was no crop response across varied nitrogen rates, indicating that the influence of prior management can negate the effects of current management. In years that uniform nitrogen rates were applied, the spatial variation in production and quality is driven by variables such as elevation, slope, aspect, or topographic position index, however across time, weather, such as precipitation and growing degree days, are the major temporal driver of variation in average production. Understanding the primary sources of field-specific variation in production and quality across the field and over time enables producers to identify if, when, and where nitrogen fertilizer should be applied. Equally important, the spatial and temporal resolution at which variability in agroecosystem performance can be detected creates a mechanism to monitor and ground-truth ecosystem response to global change.


### Introduction


* Introduce Industrial Agriculture – Same as ICPA
  + Describe the input-centric nature of industrial agriculture and the benefits such as increased yields and the theoretical meeting of required calories for all people (however because of food waste and distribution disparity we still have hunger and starvation). 
  + Address the consequences of industrial agriculture such as GHG emissions and non-point pollution.
  +	Discuss the potential to use data to optimize our inputs to meet our goals while reducing the consequences of current approaches.
*	Field Specificity
  +	To improve our decisions in a more sustainable fashion, we need to think about the ecology of the systems we are managing
  +The site, time, and history specificity of fields has complicated integration of ecological principles into an agriculture focused on regionwide prescriptions.

*	Adaptive Management >> Precision Agriculture
  +	Crop managers now have the ability to generate field-specific management plans using field-specific data to optimize inputs based on pollution minimization and profit maximization
    1) Right place, right amount, right time, right input – precision agriculture
    2) Use slide showing profit maximization
b.	Step towards sustainable agriculture by optimizing inputs based on site-specific and temporal specific conditions -> adaptive management 
i.	For example, traditional nitrogen (N) fertilizer management consisted of applying a uniform rate, causing N inefficiencies and non-point nitrate pollution.
ii.	Discuss precision agriculture potential to reduce N loss by tailoring N rates within fields rather than applying a uniform rate. However, farmers need to turn a profit and so N rates can be optimized on maximizing NR as well. 
VI.	Justification
a.	Precision agriculture technologies provide an empirical approach to adaptive management.
b.	Understanding the primary sources of field-specific variation in production and quality across the field and over time enables producers to identify if, when, and where nitrogen fertilizer should be applied. 
c.	Equally important, the spatial and temporal resolution at which variability in agroecosystem performance can be detected creates a mechanism to monitor and ground-truth ecosystem response to global change.
VII.	Goal and Objectives
a.	This research seeks to identify spatiotemporal drivers of variation in production (grain yield), quality (grain protein), and net-returns for Northern Great Plains small-grain agroecosystems and evaluates their relatedness and consistency between fields.
b.	What are the drivers of variability in production, quality, and net-returns within fields for a given year? How does this vary for the same field in different years i.e. drivers of variation across years?
i.	evaluate the drivers of spatial variation in production, quality, and net-returns for wheat within fields with a sensitivity and variance component analysis on the residuals of crop yield or protein for parameters from each field and each year
ii.	What is the major driver of variation for a field in a given year? Are there commonalities between drivers of variation in the same field for different years? 
c.	How consistent are drivers of variability for fields of the same farm? Same region?
i.	Are there commonalities in the drivers of variation for fields in the same farm? Are the drivers of variation for all fields of a farm consistent for a given year? How do these change between years? Are there differences between fields/farms in a region? Are there differences in fields/farms across regions?
i.	Compare results of the sensitivity analysis between fields by farm and region. Compare different regions.
